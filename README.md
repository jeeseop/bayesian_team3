# bayesian_team3


## target specification

* UAV with radius 0.25m sphere

* Red color



## start gazebo simulation environment
```
roslaunch mbzirc_gazebo challenge1_simulator_proj2.launch
```

## start uav operating software
```
roslaunch mbzirc_gazebo challenge1_system_proj2.launch
```

## move target uav randomly

* movement time and cycle number can be changed in the python code

* Random movement code is alreay implemented in the python code

* The range of the movement can be changed in the uavmove.py

* 2 is recommended for time gap value

```
cd ~/bayesian-robotics-ws/src/mbzirc_gazebo/ && ./uavmove.py
```


## move target uav following eplipse trajectory

* cycle number defines the total period number that uav will operate

* time gap is fixed(recommended)

* x_axis value is the square root of the major axis

* y_axis value is the square root of the minor axis


```
cd ~/bayesian-robotics-ws/src/mbzirc_gazebo/ && ./uavmove2.py
```

## Perception

Make sure you've launched the UAV in the air, so that it can see the red ball.


You may also need to move it near the ball.


*Note*: The Z estimate is very much an estimate, there's something I'm not understanding
about the perspective math. I've applied a scaling factor which shouldn't be necessary to make the 
numbers reasonable. Later I will update it.

```
rosrun team3_perception perception.py
